Good explanation of what you saw last night...for us this far South, we see a lot of the reddish pink because at our latitude,  we see the upper altitude mostly. We in the South experienced something very unique and possibly once in a lifetime for those that were curious...

Boa explicação do que você viu ontem à noite... para nós, no extremo sul, vemos muito rosa avermelhado porque em nossa latitude, vemos principalmente a altitude superior. Nós, no Sul, vivemos algo muito único e possivelmente único na vida para aqueles que estavam curiosos...

## the geomagnetic Hpo index

The geomagnetic Hpo index is a Kp-like index with a time resolution of half an hour, called Hp30, and one hour, called Hp60. besides that, the Hpo index is not capped at 9 like Kp, but is an open ended index that describes the strongest geomagnetic storms more nuanced than the three-hourly Kp, which is limited to the maximum value of 9. Next to the Hpo we also provide the linear apo index (ap30 and ap60). The Hpo index was developed in the H2020 project SWAMI and is described in [Yamazaki et al (2022)](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2022GL098860).
